# Goqueue

I attempted to write a message queue in Rust, and I wasn't having a great time. I wanted to
see if I would have a better experience in Go where I can just pass pointers around and
disregard enforced memory safety. This system is VERY basic, and there are certainly bugs.
At the moment, I've just written it as a proof of concept, but I would like to do the
following before I'd consider this to be actually useful:

- Create some basic API libraries
  - Go
  - TypeScript
